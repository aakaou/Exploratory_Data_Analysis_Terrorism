# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Terrorism

This project aims to analyze the "Global Terrorism" dataset as a security/defense analyst to identify hot zones of terrorism and derive valuable insights.

# Code Outline

1. Import necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
2. Load the dataset "globalterrorismdb_0718dist.csv" into a pandas dataframe.
3. Explore the dataframe and clean the data.
4. Perform exploratory data analysis by answering the following questions:
    * What are the most common types of attacks?
    * What are the most targeted countries?
    * What are the most targeted regions?
    * What are the most targeted cities?
    * What are the most common weapon types used in attacks?
    * What are the most common targets of attacks?
    * What is the trend of terrorism over the years?
5. Visualize the results.

# Insights and Security Issues

As a security/defense analyst, the EDA may provide insights such as:

* Identifying regions and countries with high terrorism activity.
* Understanding the most common types of attacks and weapon usage.
* Highlighting cities and targets that are frequently targeted.
* Uncovering trends and patterns in terrorism over the years.

These insights can aid in devising strategic defense measures and prioritizing security efforts to mitigate terrorism threats effectively.
